## Abstract for v1 Manuscript

Blood feeding ectoparasites of bats have been found to contain insect-specific and vertebrate-infecting viruses, some of which are relatives of human infecting viruses. While some of these viruses have been speculated as being of bat origin, only few have been shown to co-occur in their specific bat hosts. To investigate the presence/absence of co-occurring viruses between these species, we compared virus sequences from bats and their blood feeding ectoparasites to investigate the presence/absence of co-occurring viruses between these species. Although vertebrate-infecting viruses were not found to co-occur between both groups, our analysis showed that shared bacteriophages may illuminate genomic and non-genomic characteristics influencing the chance of co-occurrence in these two systems. We observed that the abundance for a majority of co-occurring viruses was higher in bat ectoparasites than in bats. We found that genome length was an important predictor of abundance in either bats or their ectoparasites, whereby an increase in genome length was associated with a greater abundance of co-occurring viruses in bats rather than in their ectoparasites. Our findings illuminate factors that may influence the outcome of vector competence investigation in bat ectoparasites.

## Peer review for v1 manuscript

Reviewer 1
The manuscript " Viromes of Obligate Parasites and Their Hosts: The Case of Bats and Bat Ectoparasites" by Alexander Tendu et al., Ref: Manuscript ID: microorganisms-2744089, provides data on the virome of blood feeding ectoparasites of bats using a metagenomic approach.

The virome refers to the collection of viruses present in a particular environment, organism, or ecological niche. In the case of obligate parasites and their hosts, understanding the virome can provide insights into the dynamics of host-parasite interactions and the coevolutionary processes that shape these relationships. Bats and their ectoparasites serve as an interesting example in this context.

Bats are known to harbor a diverse array of viruses, and some of these viruses can cause diseases in humans and other animals. However, it's essential to recognize that not all viruses carried by bats are harmful, and bats play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance by controlling insect populations and serving as pollinators.

Ectoparasites are organisms that live on the external surface of their host. In the case of bats, ectoparasites include various arthropods such as fleas, ticks, mites, and flies. These ectoparasites can act as vectors for transmitting viruses between bats or from bats to other animals.

To study the viromes of bats and their ectoparasites, scientists have to find and describe the viruses that live in these groups. Usually, this is done using metagenomic methods, which take genetic material directly from environmental samples (like bat guano or ectoparasites) and sequence it to find viral genomes.

Several studies have investigated the viromes of bats and their ectoparasites to better understand the diversity of viruses, their prevalence, and potential transmission pathways. These studies have identified novel viruses and have contributed to our understanding of the ecology of viruses in these ecosystems.

Key findings from such research include:
1.Diversity of Viruses: Bats and their ectoparasites harbor a diverse range of viruses, including novel and previously unknown species. This diversity reflects the complex interactions within bat populations and between bats and their ectoparasites.

2.Virus Transmission: Ectoparasites can serve as vectors for the transmission of viruses between bats or from bats to other animals. Understanding these transmission pathways is crucial for predicting and preventing the spillover of bat viruses into human populations.

3.Co-evolution: The coevolutionary dynamics between bats, ectoparasites, and their viruses are complex and can influence the persistence and evolution of viral species. This includes the potential for host-switching events, where viruses adapt to new host species.

Studying the viromes of obligate parasites and their hosts, such as bats and their ectoparasites, contributes to our broader understanding of viral ecology, evolution, and the factors influencing the emergence of infectious diseases. It also has implications for public health, wildlife conservation, and the management of emerging infectious diseases.

While this study provides preliminary data that should be further investigated, the general scientific tone of the manuscript sounds good and is worthy of publication after a few revisions.

In the "Introduction" section, the aim of the study result is ambiguous; I suggest improving this aspect by better explaining the scientific basis that led to this demanding study.

The material and methods are well structured and easy to follow.

The "Discussion" and the "Conclusion" should be better structured to stress the importance of this study and its practical implications.

General comments 

The study intends to examine the co-occurrence of viruses in bats and their hematophagous ectoparasites. Samples are taken from bats and ectoparasites, revealing that no viruses are identified, which could infect bats. All viruses are bacteriophages, which infect bacteria; thus the true hosts of the bacteriophages are found among members of the gut microbiomes of bats and ectoparasites. Albeit, some contamination may have originated from the skin/cuticula biome.
The methods used to sample viruses are markedly different (anal swaps and whole animal analysis), which makes the outcome difficult if not impossible to assess in quantitative terms. The amount of material examined for ectoparasites was likely manifold higher than for bats. This should not impede a qualitative comparison of bacteriophages of the two gut communities.
The methods for the identification of bacteriophages conform to current standards.
The authors conclude that the study illuminates factors that influence investigations.
 
Re: the frame /objective of the study.
The introduction provides a general and rather vague introduction explaining that the study has relevance for vector competence studies. It might very well have been the intention or hope that they would find corona, herpes, or other viruses, but as the results show, the methodology is poorly chosen. The authors need to reframe their study and provide an introduction that permits the readers to appreciate the results, in a non-vector biology context - which means that a new introduction must be written.
The authors must detach themselves from their original aim, peruse their study from a new perspective, and subsequently rewrite the introduction and discussion. Most importantly they must navigate towards a conclusion, which is far more interesting than “the study illuminates factors that influence investigations”.
I propose that they (given the result, design, and methodology) focus on the occurrence of bacteriophages within the gut microbiome, and how these are maintained. With this, you can maintain the M&M as is, and simply shift the frame of understanding. In doing I would emphasize that:
1. Bat are insectivores and will continuously be infected with bacteriophages of insect gut microbiomes.
2. Bats will in varying degrees perform social and self-grooming, which may lead to infection with bacteriophages of their ectoparasites.
3. The question is whether a constant flow of insect gut microbiome bacteriophages affects the virome of the bats – and if not, why?
4. Is the bat-to-bat transmission more important than the food-borne contribution, if not why?

I’m not saying that you need to follow the mentioned idea, but something similar must be chosen because the presented paper from a vector biologist's point of view is fundamentally flawed; conceptually and methodologically. Pls talk with a gut microbiome specialist and inquire about the state-of-the-art on the top-down/bottom-up regulation within gut microbiome communities. Your study may be the first to investigate the specificity of gut microbiome bacteriophages in a natural mammalian system that involves a constant flow of bacteriophages from non-mammalian sources. Check if it was done for birds and whether these ideas are raised in the current discussions on “insects for food and feed”.
 Re: Abundance of bacteriophages
The authors compared the abundance of bacteriophages and found that the number is higher in ectoparasites (Fig 1 A). As far as can see it only means that the anal swaps were relatively ineffective.
Re: Table 1
The table is impossible to read and it took me far too long to maneuver between the content, abbreviations, and the following legend. Pls revise the table such that it can be read from the page it appears. Do not allow numbers to be split over two lines. Do not use non-conventional abbreviations for species names.  
Re: Fig 2.
Figure 2 is the first one to be mentioned in the text. The first to be mentioned should be named No. 1
